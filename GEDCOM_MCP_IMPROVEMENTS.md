# GEDCOM MCP Server - Improvement Plan

This document outlines the improvements and future development plans for the GEDCOM MCP server, based on our recent analysis and discussions.

## Current Status

The GEDCOM MCP server is a functional tool for querying genealogical data from GEDCOM files through the Model Control Protocol (MCP). It provides a comprehensive set of tools for:
- Loading and parsing GEDCOM files
- Searching and querying people, families, events, and places
- Managing genealogical data (adding, updating, removing records)
- Analyzing genealogical data (statistics, duplicates, timelines)
- Finding relationships between individuals

Recent fixes have addressed critical bugs and improved code quality while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Improvement Areas

### 1. Enhanced Search Capabilities

#### Fuzzy Search
**Problem**: Exact string matching can miss records due to typos or name variations
**Solution**: Implement fuzzy search using libraries like `fuzzywuzzy` or `python-Levenshtein`

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def fuzzy_search_person(name: str, ctx: Context, threshold: int = 80) -> list:
    """Search for persons with fuzzy name matching"""
    # Implementation using fuzzy string matching
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Find records despite typos in names
- Handle name variations (e.g., "Jon" vs "John")
- Improve search recall while maintaining precision

### 2. Progress Indicators

#### Long-Running Operations
**Problem**: Large GEDCOM files can take significant time to load/parse with no user feedback
**Solution**: Implement progress tracking for operations

```python
class ProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self, total_items: int, description: str):
        self.total_items = total_items
        self.processed = 0
        self.description = description
    
    def update(self, increment: int = 1):
        # Report progress at regular intervals
        pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Better user experience for large datasets
- Visibility into system status
- Ability to estimate completion times

### 3. Data Validation Tools

#### Data Integrity Checks
**Problem**: GEDCOM files may contain inconsistent or invalid data
**Solution**: Comprehensive validation tools

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def validate_gedcom_data(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Validate GEDCOM data integrity and consistency"""
    # Check for:
    # - Invalid dates (future dates, impossible lifespans)
    # - Inconsistent relationships
    # - Orphaned records
    # - Missing required fields
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Identify data quality issues
- Help users clean their genealogical data
- Prevent errors in downstream processing

### 4. Enhanced Duplicate Detection

#### Sophisticated Matching
**Problem**: Current duplicate detection is basic
**Solution**: Advanced matching algorithms

**Benefits**:
- Reduce false positives/negatives
- Handle complex name variations
- Consider multiple data points (dates, places, relationships)

### 5. Better Error Handling

#### Recovery-Oriented Error Messages
**Problem**: Generic error messages don't help users resolve issues
**Solution**: Structured errors with recovery suggestions

```python
class GedcomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str, error_code: str, recovery_suggestion: str):
        self.message = message
        self.error_code = error_code
        self.recovery_suggestion = recovery_suggestion
        super().__init__(self.message)
```

**Benefits**:
- Help users understand and resolve errors
- Provide actionable next steps
- Enable automated error recovery in some cases

### 6. Batch Operations

#### Efficient Bulk Processing
**Problem**: Performing operations on many records requires multiple API calls
**Solution**: Batch operation tools

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def batch_update_person_attributes(updates: list, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Update multiple person attributes in a single operation"""
    # More efficient than multiple individual updates
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced API overhead
- Better performance for bulk operations
- Atomic operations with rollback capabilities

### 7. Advanced Querying

#### Complex Data Filtering
**Problem**: Current query capabilities are limited
**Solution**: Rich query language support

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def query_people_advanced(ctx: Context, query: dict) -> dict:
    """Advanced querying with complex conditions"""
    # Support for:
    # - Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
    # - Comparison operators ($gt, $lt, $eq, etc.)
    # - Regular expressions
    # - Nested field queries
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- More precise data retrieval
- Complex analytical queries
- Better integration with AI agent workflows

### 8. Relationship Analysis

#### Advanced Relationship Tools
**Problem**: Basic relationship finding is limited
**Solution**: Sophisticated relationship analysis

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def analyze_family_connections(person_ids: list, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """Analyze connection patterns between multiple people"""
    # Features:
    # - Common ancestors
    # - Connection strength metrics
    # - Cluster analysis
    # - Shortest path analysis
    pass
```

**Benefits**:
- Deeper genealogical insights
- Research assistance for complex family histories
- Network analysis capabilities
